## How to install

Run `ng version` and `npm -v` to see your versions of Angular and Node. 
You need versions:
Angular CLI: 14.1.0
Node: 16.10.0 to work.

To switch in right node version, I recommend to download Node Version Manager.
In other case, you need to uninstall your Node and install Node 16.10.0.

If you have other installed Angular version you need to unistall it:
1. Run `npm unistall -g @angular/cli`
2. Run `npm cache clean --force`
3. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@14.1.0`
