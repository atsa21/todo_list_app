## How to install

Run `ng version` and `npm -v` to see your versions of Angular and Node. 
You need versions:
Angular CLI: 14.1.0
Node: 16.10.0 to work.

To switch in right node version, I recommend to download Node Version Manager.
Steps to change Node version by Node Version Manager:
1. Open Terminal as administrator.
2. To install Node version 16.10.0 run `nvm install 16.10.0`.
3. To see all available Node versions run `nvm list`.
4. To set needed Node version run `nvm use 16.10.0`.

In other case, you need to uninstall your Node and install Node 16.10.0.

To install Angular run `npm install -g @angular/cli@14.1.0`
If you have other installed Angular version you need to unistall it:
1. To uninstall Angular run `npm unistall -g @angular/cli`.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force`.
3. To install needed Angular version run `npm install -g @angular/cli@14.1.0`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Hosting

To deploy project:
1. Run `ng build`.
